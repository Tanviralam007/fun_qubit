# Superposition

- **Superposition** allows a quantum bit (**qubit**) to exist in **multiple states simultaneously**.
- Unlike a **classical bit** (which can only be `0` or `1`), a qubit in superposition can be in a **combination of both states**.

### How Electrons Behave
- In quantum mechanics, an electron does not have a definite position or momentum until it is observed.
- Instead, it exists as a **probability cloud**, representing the likelihood of being in various positions simultaneously.
- Similarly, a qubit in superposition exists in a combination of states (`0` and `1`) until it is measured.

### Analogy
Imagine a coin that is "halfway" between heads and tails. This is a simple analogy for a **qubit in superposition**.

## Measurement and Probability
- When a qubit is measured, it **collapses** into a definite state (`0` or `1`).
- The probability of measuring a particular state is represented as a **percentage**.  

### Example
A qubit in a **balanced superposition** has:
- **50% chance** of being measured as `0`.
- **50% chance** of being measured as `1`.

## Why Should You Understand Superposition?
- Superposition enables qubits to **store more information** than classical bits.
- By representing **multiple possibilities at once**, qubits unlock the potential for significantly **greater computational power** in quantum systems.

## Probability Distribution

## Understanding Probability in Qubits
When a qubit is in superposition, it has a **probability distribution** for being measured as either `0` or `1`.  

### Example
- There might be a **50% chance** of measuring it as `0`.
- Similarly, there might be a **50% chance** of measuring it as `1`.

---

## Representation
- This can be visualized as a **spectrum**, where the qubit is not definitively in one state but rather in a **combination of both states** until it is observed.

---

## Qubit Notation
- In classical computing, a bit is represented as either `0` or `1`.
- In quantum computing, a **qubit** is represented using the notation `|ψ⟩`.
- It can be expressed as a **linear combination** of its basis states:
  - `|0⟩` and `|1⟩`.

### Measurement
Upon measurement, the qubit **collapses** to one of the states (`0` or `1`) based on the **probability distribution** defined by its superposition.
