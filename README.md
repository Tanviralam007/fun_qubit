- **Pauli-Y Gate**  
- **Pauli-Z Gate**  
- **Hadamard Gate (H Gate)**  
- **Phase Gate (S Gate)**  
- **T Gate (π/4 Phase Gate)**  
- **Identity Gate (I Gate)**  
- **Rotation Gates**  
  - Rx(θ)  
  - Ry(θ)  
  - Rz(θ)  

#### Multi-Qubit Gates

**start with a simple game:**
* Start with a coin facing "heads."
* Computer's Turn: The computer decides whether to flip the coin.
* Person's Turn: The person decides whether to flip the coin.
* Computer's Turn: The computer decides whether to flip the coin again.
* **Determine Winner:**
    * If the coin is "heads" after the final flip, the computer wins.
    * If the coin is "tails" after the final flip, the person wins.
